filenames
vs paths
------------------
Briefly: a
file name
is its
entry in
the
directory
listing
(d_name)
-> file
names are
only
unique
within a
directory
-> a file
name by
itself is
useless
unless we
know what
directory
it is in
Most
programs
and
libraries
that work
with file
names
actually
work with
paths -> a
path says
how to
find a
file from
a
particular
starting
point
Absolute
paths
begin with
/ (the
root of
the
directory
tree)

/foo/bar/baz/quux
