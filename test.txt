Condition variables
• Basically a combination of locks and signal.
• Condition variables are data structures that are used to wait for a condition to be true.
• It is an explicit queue that threads can put themselves on to wait for a condition/resource.
• Three functions:
• phthread_cond_wait(pthread_cond_t *cond, pthread_mutex_t *mut)
• release lock and put thread to sleep until condition is signaled
• it re-acquires the lock before it resume the thread
• pthread_cond_signal(pthread_cond_t *
